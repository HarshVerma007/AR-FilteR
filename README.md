# AR-FilteR
Overview

AR Filter is a Unity project that allows you to create augmented reality (AR) filters using Unity's AR Foundation package. This readme file provides an overview of the project and guides you through the process of creating your own AR filters.

Prerequisites
Before getting started with AR Filter, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

Unity version 2020.3 or later
AR Foundation package
Android with AR capabilities

Getting Started
To begin creating your AR filters, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the AR Filter project from the GitHub repository.

2. Open Unity and create a new project. Choose a suitable name and location for your project.

3. Import the AR Foundation package into your Unity project. To do this, navigate to "Window" > "Package Manager" and search for "AR Foundation." Click "Install" to add the package to your project.

4. Open the AR Filter project you downloaded or cloned from the repository.

5. Navigate to the "Scenes" folder and open the "SampleScene" scene. This scene contains a basic setup for an AR filter.

6. Explore the scene hierarchy and inspect the objects and components. You will find a main camera, directional light, and an AR Session Origin.

7. Create your AR filter by adding 3D objects, effects, animations, or any other visual elements to the scene. You can also modify the existing objects or add scripts to control their behavior.

8. Iterate and refine your AR filter based on feedback and testing. Experiment with different visual elements, interactions, or effects to enhance the user experience.
